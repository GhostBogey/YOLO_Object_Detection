# YOLO_Object_Detection
# Facial Recognition
I have been intrested in object detection softwares since Spring 2018 and have been messing around with it in my free time.

At first, my friends and I wanted to make a Hackathon project for HACKUMBC Spring 2018 that would detect a face and when requested could snap and picture and store the image. With many complications, my group was unsuccessful with storing the image as it would just erase any information it orginally had. In the end the program could  only remember one face from a file we would give it.

I would very much want to keep implementing this code as it is what defined my intrest in computer science.


# Detecting Eggs
As a side project with a friend of mine, we wanted to build a machine that would make breakfast. With the task of pouring milk and making fried eggs.
The first step for me was to find a way for the machine to pickup the right object and using opencv, YOLO, was perfect. I implemented the code to find an object and guess what it was, based on that guess, if it was eggs preform action X, if it was milk preform action Y, and if anything else preform action Z.

Since I do not know howto train my own model, I was stuckusing the limited amount YOLO already knew. And in my case was very bad since milkand eggs were not in its database. I was stuck with an egg that was 54% a toilet. 

I have not picked up the projet since March, and am now enrolled in a AI and Data Science course, trying to learn how to train my very own dataset for this project.
