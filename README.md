# YOLO_Object_Detection
I have been intrested in object detection softwares since Spring 2018 and have been messing around with it in my free time.

At first, my friends and I wanted to make a Hackathon project for HACKUMBC Spring 2018 that would detect a face and when requested could snap and picture and store the image. With many complications, my group was unsuccessful with storing the image as it would just erase any information it orginally had. In the end the program could  only remember one face from a file we would give it.

I would very much want to keep implementing this code as it is what defined my intrest in computer science.
